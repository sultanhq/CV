I am a full stack Ruby developer with a passion for understanding how things work from the ground up.

I am an independent learner and problem-solver who is knowledgeful of coding principles and has experience in using various hardware and software technologies, web frameworks and testing systems.

I am able to offer an ability to think critically while also being able to create solutions or improvements to a project.
As well as being competent at the Ruby stack, I am a fast learner who is able to pick up programming languages quickly.

I am looking for a job where I am constantly challenged, encouraged to improve and be free to explore the limits of my capabilities whilst also being a positive and valued part of a team.

## Skills:


### Problem Solver
I am able to understand problems and have the skill of being able to envisage designs or systems in my head; Which I then relish the challenge of putting that vision into practice to create a solution.

A good example of this was creating a series of tools for my previous employer. It allowed them to see where the business was struggling with invoice payment times and stock losses. The tools reduced losses by 90%, and also halved the amount of unpaid invoices.

### Fast Learner
For my one week project [(Twitter Forest)](https://github.com/sultanhq/twitter_forest)  at Makers Academy, our team found that our in-browser project required live communication with another service. I found that WebSockets was required, which I then learnt and implemented into production in under 2 days.

### Not scared to try
I am not afraid to try something to see if it works, most people that know me call me a tinkerer. This skill has helped me when I was developing a new frame for a quadcopter, the 3d printer I had was not able to print at the precision I required, so I looked at the source code and tweaked it to allow it to produce prints at twice the factory resolution.

### Communication
Some of my spare time is taken up as a Scout leader; in that role, communication is key for the success in getting the message across. This skill also passes over to teaching which I have found very useful when pair programming.

### Enthusiasm

During the development of my Final project at Makers Academy, which my team worked on: - an interactive illuminated cube to display information. Thanks to my constant inquisitiveness and constant striving to answer the question 'What can we do better', we was able to produce an MVP within 3 days and managed to implement all the features we originally set out to do along with other exciting features.
